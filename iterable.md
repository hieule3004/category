# Iterable
- Data structure that represent a collections. Thus, can be iterated (imperative) or recursed (declarative).

### Recursion scheme
- Structure-level recursion (as oppose to function-level recursion) => feel very object-oriented

### Bonus: related
- Y combinator is function-level recursion
- Trampoline pattern allow writing recursion-style code with iteration implementation
