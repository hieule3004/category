# combinator: monad perspective

### Abstract
#### Relation
\* SKI system -> Applicative

\* BCKW system -> Monad

#### Lambda calculus
\* variables have arbitrary type
- combinators have arbitrary arity

\* combinators are total function (no abstraction)
- variable: simple argument return (command no args) e.g. I, K
- application: (command with args) the return type of combinator is return type of the command
- Corollary: at most 1 argument (function/variable) act as command
    - new return type to maximise generality of applicable function
    - unique due to constructive proof: if there are 2 such functions (e.g a -> c and b -> c), then a merge function must exist (e.g. c -> c -> d) then d is the new return type.
- corollary: possible to define once removed algorithmically
    - replace command with free variable; add that variable as first arg to old command to make new command type signature; add new command as first arg of combinator to make once removed combinator
    - issue: command calling itself (e.g. a -> b -> b), which free more type constraint than simple combinator


### Monad
\* Functor -> Applicative -> Monad

\* Function type (simplified Reader monad) (->) r
- Function
    + id :: a -> a = I
    + flip :: (b -> a -> c) -> a -> b -> c = C
- Functor
    + fmap :: (a -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b) = B
- Applicative
    + return :: a -> (r -> a) = K
    + ap :: (r -> a -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b) = S
- Monad (category theory definition)
    + unit :: a -> (r -> a) = K
    + join :: (r -> r -> a) -> (r -> a) = W

\* Alternative to join: more practical usage (functional programming definition)
- bind :: (r -> a) -> (a -> r -> b) -> (r -> b) = C (B S C)
    + use with do notation: similar to ; in imperative language
- reverse bind :: (a -> r -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b) = B S C
    + flip argument of bind

### Bonus: Combinator calculus
\* SKI system
- S = B(BW)(BBC) = B(B(BW)C)(BB)
- I = SK_ = CK_ = WK

\* BCKW system
- B = S(KS)K 
- C = S(BBS)(KK) = S(S(K(S(KS)K))S)(KK)
- W = SS(SK)

\* BTAM system: BCKW alternative
- T = CI
- A = KI
- M = WI

### Bonus: Fixed point
Y :: (a -> a) -> a
Y f = f (Y f)
- this is recursion
