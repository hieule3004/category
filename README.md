### Monad
* Functor -> Applicative -> Monad
* Function type (simplified Reader monad) (->) r
- Function
id :: a -> a = I
flip :: (b -> a -> c) -> a -> b -> c = C
- Functor
fmap :: (a -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b) = B
- Applicative
return :: a -> (r -> a) = K
ap :: (r -> a -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b) = S
- Monad
unit :: a -> (r -> a) = K
join :: (r -> r -> a) -> (r -> a) = W
* Alternative: more practical usage than join
- bind :: (r -> a) -> (a -> r -> b) -> (r -> b) = W S
- reverse bind :: (a -> r -> b) -> (r -> a) -> (r -> b) = W S C

### Relation
* SKI system -> Applicative
* BCKW system -> Monad

### Bonus: Combinator calculus conversion
* SKI system
- S = B(BW)(BBC) = B(B(BW)C)(BB)
- I = SK_ = CK_ = WK
* BCKW system
- B = S(KS)K 
- C = S(BBS)(KK) = S(S(K(S(KS)K))S)(KK)
- W = SS(SK)
* BTAM system: BCKW alternative
- T = CI
- A = KI
- M = WI
