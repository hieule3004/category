# Science

- Science is the way human try to view the world from our perspective.
- Each subject studies a specific area of the world, in term of a model.

### Model
- Model follow a logical approach:
    - The model follow a set of unprovable assumptions, called axioms.
    - Every statements come with further assumptions and prove some results, called theorem.
        - There can be statemente with no further assumptions made (aside from axioms), called principle.
        - In case the statement comes with no proof, it is called a conjecture.
- So what's the deal with proof and assumptions:
    - Statements can be building blocks, to make more complicated statements that are useful for real problems.
        - By assuming existing statements or having shared set of assumptions with other statements, we can deduce logically the "world" or model the statement live in.
    - We can assume everything to be true until we can prove it false, thus making a better model.
        - If a statement is made false, we can just backtrack assumptions and modify our model accordingly by removing those false statements from our model (or move them to a more restricted abstract model where they can be true)
        - This is the fundamental of "scientific" thinking: to be optimistic e.g. instead of assuming everything is false until proven true, which although is not wrong phylosophically, is a less useful way of thinking and will hinder progression to the goal of approaching the truth / having a model as close to the truth as possible. 
    - This keep our model to be consistent with our goal: to make a model of some abstraction (phylosophy i.e. maths) or real world (science) that we can reason about.
